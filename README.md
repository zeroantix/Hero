**Extra Metadata Loader** plugin required not only for Logos, but to take advantage of Game Music and/or Alternative Background Images in Game Details View.

Game Music will play in Game Details View (subject to Game Trailer not playing) if a .mp3 is downloaded, named: **Music**.mp3 and placed in the game(s) Extra Metadata folder.

Alternative Background images can also be displayed in Game Details View. As above, same process but the image downlaoded must be .jpg format. Rename the image: **Wallpaper**.jpg

**Please Note!** This theme was designed before the introduction of Playnite Sounds recent update that allows Game Music to play out of the box. There is likely to be confilicts if you use such with this theme in it's present state.
